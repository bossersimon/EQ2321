## intro questions
1.
> You can hear most of what is said at 1500Hz. At 2500-3000 its clear enough. It was a bit hard to interpret "medicine" from the female voice. 
2.
> I think it starts sounding pretty bad below 4000Hz.
3.
> At 8 kHz we can capture frequencies as high as 4 kHz. Connecting to the previous exercise, It seems that this sampling frequency is high enough to be able to understand what is being said, but still quite low. I think this is done to save some resources, especially since it's "old" telephony.

## Voiced and Unvoiced Speech Sounds
2. 
> High pitch region: 5 peaks in 6ms -> 833 Hz. Low pitch region: 10 peaks in 40ms -> 250 Hz (Maybe it's supposed to be ~125 Hz, which is more typical for a male).
